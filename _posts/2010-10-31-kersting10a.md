title: Hierarchical Convex NMF for Clustering Massive Data
abstract: 'We present an extension of convex-hull non-negative matrix factorization
  (CH-NMF) which was recently proposed as a large scale variant of convex non-negative
  matrix factorization or Archetypal Analysis. CHNMF factorizes a non-negative data
  matrix V into two non-negative matrix factors V = WH such that the columns of W
  are convex combinations of certain data points so that they are readily interpretable
  to data analysts. There is, however, no free lunch: imposing convexity constraints
  on W typically prevents adaptation to intrinsic, low dimensional structures in the
  data. Alas, in cases where the data is distributed in a non-convex manner or consists
  of mixtures of lower dimensional convex distributions, the cluster representatives
  obtained from CH-NMF will be less meaningful. In this paper, we present a hierarchical
  CH-NMF that automatically adapts to internal structures of a dataset, hence it yields
  meaningful and interpretable clusters for non-convex datasets. This is also confirmed
  by our extensive evaluation on DBLP publication records of 760,000 authors, 4,000,000
  images harvested from the web, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft guilds.'
