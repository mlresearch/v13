title: Learning Polyhedral Classifiers Using Logistic Function
abstract: In this paper we propose a new algorithm for learning polyhedral classifiers.
  In contrast to existing methods for learning polyhedral classifier which solve a
  constrained optimization problem, our method solves an unconstrained optimization
  problem. Our method is based on a logistic function based model for the posterior
  probability function. We propose an alternating optimization algorithm, namely,
  SPLA1 (Single Polyhedral Learning Algorithm1) which maximizes the loglikelihood
  of the training data to learn the parameters. We also extend our method to make
  it independent of any user specified parameter (e.g., number of hyperplanes required
  to form a polyhedral set) in SPLA2. We show the effectiveness of our approach with
  experiments on various synthetic and real world datasets and compare our approach
  with a standard decision tree method (OC1) and a constrained optimization based
  method for learning polyhedral sets.
