title: Content-based Image Retrieval with Multinomial Relevance Feedback
abstract: The paper considers an interactive search paradigm in which at each round
  a user is presented with a set of k images and is required to select one that is
  closest to her target. Performance is measured by the number of rounds needed to
  identify a specific target image or to find an image among the t nearest neighbours
  to the target in the database. Building on earlier work we assume a multinomial
  user model with the probabilities of response proportional to a function of the
  distance to the target. The conjugate prior Dirichlet distribution is used to model
  the problem motivating an algorithm that trades exploration and exploitation in
  presenting the images in each round. Experimental results verify the fit of the
  model with the problem as well as show that the new approach compares favourably
  with previous work.
