title: 'Minimum Conditional Entropy Clustering: A Discriminative Framework for Clustering'
abstract: "In this paper, we introduce an assumption which makes it possible to extend
  the learning ability of discriminative model to unsupervised setting. We propose
  an information-theoretic framework as an implementation of the low-density separation
  assumption. The proposed framework provides a unified perspective of Maximum Margin
  Clustering (MMC), Discriminative k-means, Spectral Clustering and Unsupervised Renyi's
  Entropy Analysis and also leads to a novel and efficient algorithm, Accelerated
  Maximum Relative Margin Clustering (ARMC), which maximizes the margin while considering
  the spread of projections and affine invariance. Experimental results show that
  the proposed discriminative unsupervised learning method is more efficient in utilizing
  data and achieves the state-of-the-art or even better performance compared with
  mainstream clustering methods."
