title: Single versus Multiple Sorting in All Pairs Similarity Search
abstract: "To save memory and improve speed, vectorial data such as images and signals
  are often represented as strings of discrete symbols (i.e., sketches). Chariker
  (2002) proposed a fast approximate method for finding neighbor pairs of strings
  by sorting and scanning with a small window. This method, which we shall call 'single
  sorting', is applied to locality sensitive codes and prevalently used in speed-demanding
  web-related applications. To improve on single sorting, we propose a novel method
  that employs blockwise masked sorting. Our method can dramatically reduce the number
  of candidate pairs which have to be verified by distance calculation in exchange
  with an increased amount of sorting operations. So it is especially attractive for
  high dimensional dense data, where distance calculation is expensive. Empirical
  results show the efficiency of our method in comparison to single sorting and recent
  fast nearest neighbor methods."
