title: Mining Recurring Concept Drifts with Limited Labeled Streaming Data
abstract: Tracking recurring concept drifts is a significant issue for machine learning
  and data mining that frequently appears in real world stream classification problems.
  It is a challenge for many streaming classification algorithms to learn recurring
  concepts in a data stream envi- ronment with unlabeled data, and this challenge
  has received little attention from the research community. Motivated by this challenge,
  this paper focuses on the problem of recurring contexts in streaming environments
  with limited labeled data. We propose a Semisupervised classification algorithm
  for data streams with REcurring concept Drifts and Limited LAbeled data, called
  REDLLA, in which, a decision tree is adopted as the classification model. When growing
  a tree, a clustering algorithm based on k-Means is installed to produce concept
  clusters and unlabeled data are labeled at leaves. In view of deviations between
  history and new concept clusters, potential concept drifts are distinguished and
  recurring concepts are maintained. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world
  data confirm the advantages of our REDLLA algorithm over two state-of-the-art online
  classification algorithms of CVFDT and CDRDT and several known online semi-supervised
  algorithms, even in the case with more than 90% unlabeled data.
