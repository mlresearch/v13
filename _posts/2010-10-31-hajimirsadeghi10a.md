title: 'Conceptual Imitation Learning: An Application to Human-robot Interaction'
abstract: In general, imitation is imprecisely used to address different levels of
  social learning from high level knowledge transfer to low level regeneration of
  motor commands. However, true imitation is based on abstraction and conceptualization.
  This paper presents a conceptual approach for imitation learning using feedback
  cues and interactive training to abstract spatio-temporal demonstrations based on
  their perceptual and functional characteristics. Abstraction, concept acquisition,
  and self-organization of proto-symbols are performed through an incremental and
  gradual learning algorithm. In this algorithm, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used
  to abstract perceptually similar demonstrations. However, abstract (relational)
  concepts emerge as a collection of HMMs irregularly scattered in the perceptual
  space. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in a human-robot interaction
  task of imitating signs produced by hand movements. Experimental results show efficiency
  of our model for concept extraction, symbol emergence, motion pattern recognition,
  and regeneration.
