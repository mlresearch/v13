title: Pairwise Measures of Causal Direction in Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models
abstract: We present new measures of the causal direction between two nongaussian
  random variables. They are based on the likelihood ratio under the linear non-gaussian
  acyclic model (LiNGAM). We also develop simple first-order approximations and analyze
  them based on related cumulant-based measures. The cumulant-based measures can be
  shown to give the right causal directions, and they are statistically consistent
  even in the presence of measurement noise. We further show how to apply these measures
  to estimate LiNGAM for more than two variables, and even in the case of more variables
  than observations. The proposed framework is statistically at least as good as existing
  ones in the cases of few data points or noisy data, and it is computationally and
  conceptually very simple.
