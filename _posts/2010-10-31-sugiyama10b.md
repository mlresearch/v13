title: The Coding Divergence for Measuring the Complexity of Separating Two Sets
abstract: In this paper we integrate two essential processes, discretization of continuous
  data and learning of a model that explains them, towards fully computational machine
  learning from continuous data. Discretization is fundamental for machine learning
  and data mining, since every continuous datum; e.g., a real-valued datum obtained
  by observation in the real world, must be discretized and converted from analog
  (continuous) to digital (discrete) form to store in databases. However, most machine
  learning methods do not pay attention to the situation; i.e., they use digital data
  in actual applications on a computer whereas assume analog data (usually vectors
  of real numbers) theoretically. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel measure of
  the difference between two sets of data, called the coding divergence, and unify
  two processes discretization and learning computationally. Discretization of continuous
  data is realized by a topological mapping (in the sense of mathematics) from the
  d-dimensional Euclidean space into the Cantor space, and the simplest model is learned
  in the Cantor space, which corresponds to the minimum open set separating the given
  two sets of data. Furthermore, we construct a classifier using the divergence, and
  experimentally demonstrate robust performance of it. Our contribution is not only
  introducing a new measure from the computational point of view, but also triggering
  more interaction between experimental science and machine learning.
