title: Ellipsoidal Support Vector Machines
abstract: This paper proposes the ellipsoidal SVM (e-SVM) that uses an ellipsoid center,
  in the version space, to approximate the Bayes point. Since SVM approximates it
  by a sphere center, e-SVM provides an extension to SVM for better approximation
  of the Bayes point. Although the idea has been mentioned before (Rujan, 1997), no
  work has been done for formulating and kernelizing the method. Starting from the
  maximum volume ellipsoid problem, we successfully formulate and kernelize it by
  employing relaxations. The resulting e-SVM optimization framework has much similarity
  to SVM; it is naturally extendable to other loss functions and other problems. A
  variant of the sequential minimal optimization is provided for efficient batch implementation.
  Moreover, we provide an online version of linear, or primal, e-SVM to be applicable
  for large-scale datasets.
