title: Generative Models of Information Diffusion with Asynchronous Timedelay
abstract: 'We address the problem of formalizing an information diffusion process
  on a social network as a generative model in the machine learning framework so that
  we can learn model parameters from the observation. Time delay plays an important
  role in formulating the likelihood function as well as for the analyses of information
  diffusion. We identified that there are two different types of time delay: link
  delay and node delay. The former corresponds to the delay associated with information
  propagation, and the latter corresponds to the delay due to human action. We further
  identified that there are two distinctions of the way the activation from the multiple
  parents is updated: nonoverride and override. The former sticks to the initial activation
  and the latter can decide to update the time to activate multiple times. We formulated
  the likelihood function of the well known diffusion models: independent cascade
  and linear threshold, both enhanced with asynchronous time delay distinguishing
  the difference in two types of delay and two types of update scheme. Simulation
  using four real world networks reveals that there are differences in the spread
  of information diffusion and they strongly depend on the choice of the parameter
  values and the denseness of the network.'
