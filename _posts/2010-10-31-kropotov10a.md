title: Variational Relevance Vector Machine for Tabular Data
abstract: We adopt the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) framework to handle cases of
  table-structured data such as image blocks and image descriptors. This is achieved
  by coupling the regularization coefficients of rows and columns of features. We
  present two variants of this new gridRVM framework, based on the way in which the
  regularization coefficients of the rows and columns are combined. Appropriate variational
  optimization algorithms are derived for inference within this framework. The consequent
  reduction in the number of parameters from the product of the tableâ€™s dimensions
  to the sum of its dimensions allows for better performance in the face of small
  training sets, resulting in improved resistance to overfitting, as well as providing
  better interpretation of results. These properties are demonstrated on synthetic
  data-sets as well as on a modern and challenging visual identification benchmark.
