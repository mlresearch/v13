title: Exploiting the High Predictive Power of Multi-class Subgroups
abstract: Subgroup discovery aims at finding subsets of a population whose class distribution
  is significantly different from the overall distribution. A number of multi-class
  subgroup discovery methods has been previously investigated, proposed and implemented
  in the CN2-MSD system. When a decision tree learner was applied using the induced
  subgroups as features, it led to the construction of accurate and compact predictive
  models, demonstrating the usefulness of the subgroups. In this paper we show that,
  given a significant, sufficient and diverse set of subgroups, no further learning
  phase is required to build a good predictive model. Our systematic study bridges
  the gap between rule learning and decision tree modelling by proposing a method
  which uses the training information associated with the subgroups to form a simple
  tree-based probability estimator and ranker, RankFree-MSD, without the need for
  an additional learning phase. Furthermore, we propose an efficient subgroup pruning
  algorithm, RankFree-Pruning, that prunes unimportant subgroups from the subgroup
  tree in order to reduce the number of subgroups and the size of the tree without
  decreasing predictive performance. Despite the simplicity of our approach we experimentally
  show that its predictive performance in general is comparable to other decision
  tree and rule learners over 10 multi-class UCI data sets.
