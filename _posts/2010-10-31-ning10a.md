title: Multi-task Learning for Recommender System
abstract: This paper focuses on exploring personalized multi-task learning approaches
  for collaborative filtering towards the goal of improving the prediction performance
  of rating prediction systems. These methods first specifically identify a set of
  users that are closely related to the user under consideration (i.e., active user),
  and then learn multiple rating prediction models simultaneously, one for the active
  user and one for each of the related users. Such learning for multiple models (tasks)
  in parallel is implemented by representing all learning instances (users and items)
  using a coupled user-item representation, and within errorinsensitive Support Vector
  Regression (e-SVR) framework applying multi-task kernel tricks. A comprehensive
  set of experiments shows that multi-task learning approaches lead to significant
  performance improvement over conventional alternatives.
