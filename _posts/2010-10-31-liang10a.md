title: Decision Tree for Dynamic and Uncertain Data Streams
abstract: Current research on data stream classification mainly focuses on certain
  data, in which precise and definite value is usually assumed. However, data with
  uncertainty is quite natural in real-world application due to various causes, including
  imprecise measurement, repeated sampling and network errors. In this paper, we focus
  on uncertain data stream classification. Based on CVFDT and DTU, we propose our
  UCVFDT (Uncertainty-handling and Concept-adapting Very Fast Decision Tree) algorithm,
  which not only maintains the ability of CVFDT to cope with concept drift with high
  speed, but also adds the ability to handle data with uncertain attribute. Experimental
  study shows that the proposed UCVFDT algorithm is efficient in classifying dynamic
  data stream with uncertain numerical attribute and it is computationally efficient.
