title: An EM Algorithm on BDDs with Order Encoding for Logic-based Probabilistic Models
abstract: Logic-based probabilistic models (LBPMs) enable us to handle various problems
  in the real world thanks to the expressive power of logic. However, most of LBPMs
  have restrictions to realize efficient probability computation and learning. We
  propose an EM algorithm working on BDDs with order encoding for LBPMs. A notable
  advantage of our algorithm over existing approaches is that it copes with multi-valued
  random variables without restrictions. The complexity of our algorithm is proportional
  to the size of the BDD. In the case of hidden Markov models (HMMs), the complexity
  is the same as that specialized for HMMs. As an example to eliminate restrictions
  of existing approaches, we utilize our algorithm to give diagnoses for failure in
  a logic circuit involving stochastic error gates.
