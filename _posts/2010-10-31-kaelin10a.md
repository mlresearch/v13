title: A Study of Approximate Inference in Probabilistic Relational Models
abstract: We tackle the problem of approximate inference in Probabilistic Relational
  Models (PRMs) and propose the Lazy Aggregation Block Gibbs (LABG) algorithm. The
  LABG algorithm makes use of the inherent relational structure of the ground Bayesian
  network corresponding to a PRM. We evaluate our approach on artificial and real
  data and show that it scales well with the size of the data set.
